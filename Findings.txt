While a hospital website should ideally have a comprehensive set of features, if you need to focus on the most essential ones, here are the top 5 main features a hospital website should have:

1. Clear Contact Information: Ensure that the hospital's contact information, including phone numbers, address, and email, is prominently displayed on the website, typically in the header or footer of every page. Quick and easy access to this information is critical for patients seeking medical assistance.

2. Services and Specialties: Provide information about the medical services and specialties offered by the hospital. This section should give an overview of the healthcare services available and any specialized departments or treatments. Many visitors come to the website looking for information on the specific services a hospital offers.

3. Physician Directory: Offer a comprehensive directory of doctors and healthcare providers who practice at the hospital. Include details like their credentials, areas of expertise, and contact information. Allow for online appointment scheduling or inquiries, which is particularly important for patients seeking specific medical care.

4. Patient Resources: Provide essential patient resources, such as forms, insurance information, billing details, and frequently asked questions (FAQs). This section can help patients navigate the administrative aspects of their care and understand their rights and responsibilities.

5. Emergency Information: Include emergency contact numbers, directions to the hospital's emergency room, and clear guidance on what to do in case of a medical emergency. This feature is crucial for those in urgent need of care and their loved ones.

These core features ensure that visitors can easily find essential information, contact the hospital, access medical services, and understand the hospital's offerings. While there are many other important features to consider, these five are fundamental for the functionality and user-friendliness of a hospital website.
